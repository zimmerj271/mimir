# T12 — Atomic message submission and idempotency

**Milestone:** M2  
**Branch:** `feature/t12-message-submit` (from updated `main`)  
**Dependencies:** T07, T10, T11  
**Status:** Design brief only; not implemented or tested.

## Objective / authorized scope
POST message creates canonical user message and durable run atomically with version CAS.

## Out of scope
Do not implement successor tasks, change shared contracts or introduce major dependencies without approval. No public per-memory CRUD, application-owned canonical memory tables, hidden direct client database/provider access, or future-web implementation.

## Additional normative Mimir integration requirement
Ensure operation ledger idempotency result is replayed before any stale expected-version conflict; expose accepted operation identity for safe recovery lookup.

## Required test scenarios and acceptance
Duplicate requests return same IDs; mismatch 409; stale version 409; rollback leaves no half-created run. Add pertinent failure, auth, boundary and concurrency tests. Prefer deterministic unit tests where possible and real-service integration tests when persistence/provider guarantees are involved.

## Required engineering review
- Read `AGENTS.md`, `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` and relevant domain documents before coding.
- Favor cohesive OOP services/models/adapters, composition and dependency injection. Do not introduce speculative frameworks or standalone business-logic functions.
- Formatting, linting, type checks, targeted tests and relevant integration checks must have **actual logged results**.
- Reviewer independently checks changed files, contracts, security, quality, tests and scope.
- No direct push to `main`; submit one PR from `feature/t12-message-submit`, obtain user approval, then merge.
- Stop at this brief's boundary; do not start a dependent task automatically.

## PR evidence / completion template
- Branch and base commit; changed paths; concise design rationale.
- Acceptance cases → test files → exact commands → results or blockers.
- New or modified public interfaces, migrations, dependencies.
- Unresolved risks and architectural deviations (explicitly none if absent).
- Reviewer outcome and user approval (pending until granted).

## Agent hardening gate
Apply repository `AGENTS.md` and language `CODING_STANDARDS.md`. Before writing observable behavior, check `SPECIFICATION_GAPS.md` and the frozen `contracts/` artifacts. Stop for missing, contradictory, or unapproved interface/state semantics; do not infer them. Map relevant acceptance IDs and tests in `TRACEABILITY.md`, execute applicable `QUALITY_GATES.md` commands, and report literal results. This gate does not expand the authorized scope of this task.

### Blocking branch acceptance checkpoint
At completion, **STOP**. Open one task-scoped PR using the root `PR_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md`. Require successful documented checks, independent coding-agent review, explicit human review and affirmative merge approval. Do not merge autonomously or begin the next task before merge confirmation and a fresh human assignment. See `AGENTS.md` and `QUALITY_GATES.md`.

**V1 normative references:** `CONTRACT_DECISIONS_V1.md`, `STATE_MACHINES.md`, `PROMPT_AND_MEMORY_CONTRACT.md`, `contracts/openapi.yaml`, `contracts/sse.schema.json`, and `contracts/errors.json` at unified-package root. These are consumed from the one shared `/contracts` directory in the monorepo; without separate copies.
